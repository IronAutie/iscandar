    """System status codes -- the ONE canonical home for them.

    Rule: a new status is added here, one line, and nowhere else.
    gen_status.py turns exactly these lines into status.h for the
    C gears, so the two languages can never drift apart. Never
    hand-edit status.h, and never hand-write a status value in
    Gears.py or in a C file: import or include it instead.
