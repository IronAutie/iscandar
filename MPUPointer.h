/* MPUPointer.h -- transcription of MPUPointer.py, the author's
 * design; the Python is the specification and this code
 * reproduces it exactly. Transcription only: no original
 * content.
 *
 * A 32-bit virtual address for the MPU, as a bitfield. The
 * word, in Motorola order (MSB first, the paper's parlance):
 *
 *     Virtual   1 bit   top bit: the word belongs to the
 *                       user's application; it is not to be
 *                       exposed directly to the microprocessor
 *                       for decoding
 *     Reserved  1 bit   not needed today; held against someday
 *     Start    15 bits  starting sector -- a name: 0..32767
 *     Count    15 bits  stored shifted: stored + 1 is the true
 *                       count, so counts run 1..32768, the
 *                       whole cube is representable, and a
 *                       zero count is not
 *
 * The Intel form declares the same fields from the low end
 * upward: Virtual at bit 0, Reserved at bit 1, Start at bits
 * 2..16, stored Count at bits 17..31. Decode order is a code
 * switch, never a bit in the word: the order argument selects
 * Motorola (the default) or Intel allocation.
 *
 * Every pointer is BORN VIRTUAL (the author's consistency
 * rule): creation through mpupointer_load always raises the
 * Virtual flag, the full cube included -- there is no way to
 * ask load for a flag-down word. A word with the flag down can
 * only enter by adoption, mpupointer_adopt, as an existing
 * word read from somewhere -- never by creation.
 *
 * Refusals: the Python raises ValueError for every field or
 * word outside its range, and never masks or truncates
 * silently, because a reliable pointer cannot be built by
 * quietly changing the caller's numbers. The C returns a
 * status instead: FAIL for every refusal, the one generic
 * caller-error code Status.py defines for this boundary
 * (Commit.c's precedent: caller error returns FAIL). No
 * pointer-specific range code exists in Status.py, and none
 * is invented here. On FAIL the output is not written, in the
 * check-then-set spirit of the commit path: a refused call
 * changes nothing. */
